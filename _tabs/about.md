## About Me:

### Early Inspirations and Journey into Programming

My fascination with technology began early, from my days playing on my PS2 to getting my first laptop in 2012. Growing up, I dreamed of being an inventor, especially after watching the first Iron Man film in 2007—I wanted to be Tony Stark. My first encounter with programming was through Globaloria in 2012, an online platform where students design and code educational games. Even though my first game didn’t work, the programming bug bit me, and it never let go.

I’ve also had mentors along the way, most notably my Uncle Matt, who has always been there to answer my beginner questions (sometimes multiple times). Today, I consider him my mentor in the field.

### My Programming Experience

My programming journey has been a bit winding. The first language I dabbled in was likely ActionScript with Adobe Flash, though I struggled to understand what I was doing so maybe I wouldn't include it. My first real success came during high school when I got into web development with HTML/CSS, which eventually led me to work with Java in my computer science courses. These early experiences fueled my desire to build and create, even without knowing where it might lead. I consider these formative years as the foundation where I learned the basics of programming.

Throughout the years, my interests have shifted—from wanting to be a game developer or a Hollywood-style hacker to exploring traditional computer science topics. Nowadays, I’m particularly interested in data visualization, AI, and VR technology. Though the road has been rocky, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made, including my recent work on Sonar Sight, a game jam submission for the 5th Bullet Hell Jam in 2024.

### Challenges and Growth

Programming has been full of challenges, from keeping project scope reasonable to maintaining confidence in my abilities. I often struggle with wanting to add complex features to projects, which can be cool but in implementation are far more effort than worth. Additionally, my confidence has wavered, especially after struggling in AP Computer Science and receiving a 2 out of 5 on the AP test. However, now as a college student, I’m determined to keep up and ask for help when needed.

When it comes to learning new skills, I’m all about hands-on experience. I tend to dive right into documentation and tutorials, learning as I go. While I haven’t read many computer science books, platforms like CodeAcademy and YouTube tutorials, along with supportive communities on Discord, have been crucial to my growth.

### Personal Background

Before becoming a full-time student at Boise State, I served in the U.S. Air Force as a Security Forces Patrolman for six and a half years. Although I decided that security and law enforcement weren’t for me, the experience was exactly what I needed at the time. My service allowed me to mature as a person and paved the opportunities I have now. Outside of programming, I enjoy playing open-world RPGs and sandbox games, and I occasionally 3D print custom designs.

### Goals and Aspirations

In the short term, I’m focused on building more projects and sharing them on this blog as a portfolio of my work. Long term, I’m aiming to secure employment in the tech field once I have my degree. I’m still exploring different areas of computer science, so I’m keeping my options open. Whether it’s robotics, VR/AR, or something else entirely, I’m excited to see where my journey takes me.

Ultimately, I want to create things that matter, things that have a use globally. I don’t aspire to be a tech billionaire; I want the work I do to have a lasting, positive impact on people. This is a lofty idealist aspiration, and I am curious to see the reality of where I end up. I just think if all I did all day was make things that are only out for a profit I wouldn't enjoy the work nearly as much.
