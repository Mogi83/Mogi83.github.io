## Purpose of this Blog

I started this blog as a way to document and review my progress as both a student and a professional. It’s a space where I can reflect on my growth, showcase my programming projects, and share what I’ve learned along the way. My goal is to provide insight into my coding journey, reveal my motivations behind various projects, and offer a glimpse into how I approach problem-solving and development.

While I don’t have a fixed schedule for content and probably never will, I anticipate that my coursework in Computer Science will naturally influence the topics I cover. Expect to see updates about my programming projects and perhaps other interesting things im up to that fit here.

## How its Made, a blog

#### Choosing the Tools

This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator recommended by my Uncle Matt, a professional in computer security since 2009. You can check out his site [here](https://0x.c0ffee.me), which runs on the same framework. I chose the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) style for its clean look and ease of use. Another benefit is that Jekyll and GitHub Pages are designed to work together as the companies are partnered.

#### Understanding Static vs. Dynamic Sites

Jekyll transforms markdown text into static web pages. Static sites like this one are built with pre-made or custom assets and don’t change unless I update them in the backend. In contrast, dynamic sites use server-side scripting languages (like PHP or Python) to generate pages on the fly based on user data and interactions.

## Learning GitHub in more depth

**Learning Git and GitHub**

Initially, my knowledge of GitHub was limited to basic file uploads and downloads. To get this site running, I had to dive deeper into repositories, settings, and GitHub Actions. My early attempts were fraught with failure, requiring me to delete and restart the repository multiple times since you can only have one site tied to your username.

After grappling with documentation, Git command line, and GUI tools, I eventually managed to publish a blank Jekyll site using the Chirpy style. I continued refining it by adding content, adjusting config files, and committing changes. Resolving config file errors was a key challenge in this process.

**Resources and Breakthroughs**

GitHub and Jekyll documentation were invaluable resources throughout this process. I found that watching videos was less helpful compared to reading through the guides and experimenting myself. A major breakthrough came when I finally understood GitHub Actions and resolved the errors in my config files, which had previously caused build and deployment failures.

## Additional Notes

**Tips for Beginners**

If you’re looking to create your own GitHub Page with Jekyll, I highly recommend thoroughly reading both documentations as they have guides for both how to make a site with just [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) or with [both](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). These resources can simplify the process considerably.

**Reflections**

This blog may not be everything I initially envisioned and is missing some features I wanted, but what it does do it does very well. It’s easy to edit and update, and I’m pleased with its overall look and the best part of all, it didn't cost me a dime. I’m excited to see how it evolves over time, especially as I continue through college and beyond. I hope it will be filled with interesting projects and insights that reflect my growth and learning.
