# Personal Programming Blog https://mogi83.github.io

## Purpose and Overview

This blog was created to document my journey as a student and a professional in computer science. It serves as a platform to reflect on my growth, share my programming projects, and explore what I've learned along the way.

## Technology

This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a popular static site generator, and styled with the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). It is backed by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for ease of use.

- **Jekyll**: Converts Markdown files into static HTML pages, making it easy to manage and update content without dealing with complex server-side code.
- **Chirpy Theme**: Offers a clean and modern design, optimized for performance and readability, and designed to integrate seamlessly with Jekyll.
